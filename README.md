# NashikWeather
This project aims to predict weather conditions in Nashik using the Ridge Regression algorithm. The dataset includes weather-related data, and the project employs machine learning techniques to forecast weather conditions.

The dataset used in this project includes weather data with features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. The data is split into training and test sets.

train.csv: Contains the training data.
test.csv: Contains the test data.
sample_submission.csv: Sample format for the submission file.
submission.csv: The predicted results in the required format.

Model:
The model used in this project is Ridge Regression, which is a type of linear regression that includes a regularization term to prevent overfitting. The model is trained on the provided training data and evaluated on the test data.

Results:
The results of the predictions are saved in the submission.csv file. The model's performance can be evaluated using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), etc.
